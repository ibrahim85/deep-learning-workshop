Installation of Packages:
For installing the above mentioned python packages please follow the procedure mentioned below.

For installing new packages, system must be connected through internet.

Press start in windows and search for "Anaconda Prompt". When you will click on the application, a prompt window will be open,wait for few seconds.

You can check/ install any package in Anaconda Python by..
      pip install package_name

f-ex: pip install numpy
and press Enter key after typing these commands.

Note. If you are installing numpy like this, it will give requirement already satisfied message on the prompt. that means package is already installed in the anaconda python.

Installing Opencv for Image processing
Start the Anaconda Prompt: Press start in windows and search for "Anaconda Prompt". when you will click on the application, a prompt window will be open, wait for few seconds.

type command:
pip install opencv-python
press Enter.

Installing Tensorflow and Keras:
Start the Anaconda Prompt in administrator mode: Press start in “windows”, type “Anaconda Prompt”, and right click on the application and click “Run as Administrator”.

Repeat step 2 
f.ex- pip install tensorflow
pip install keras


Help: You can also take help of YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0qhKP2liHs for sample installation of Anaconda + Tensorflow + Keras

Note: If you want to work with regular python installed from (https://www.python.org/downloads/), installation of numpy, pandas, sklearn, ntlk, tensorflow, keras libraries can be still done using “pip install” command similar to step 2 and 3. However, installation of Anaconda Python is highly encouraged rather than naïve python.
